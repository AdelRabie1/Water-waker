# Water-waker
## Overview
A water gun that utilizes AI to locate your face and shoot water at it. I use OpenCV python library to implement the face detection. Afterwards, I use 2 DC motors to implement the face tracking. As soon as the Water gun is aimed at my face, a third servo motor activates the trigger, hence causing the gun to shoot water on my face.
